 

SLO: e.g. let’s say we will respond 95% of the reqs in 2 secs # hits/sec for the users. How many users we want to process if the request comes for all the users. what should be the system
validic api: We should know the frequency of the requests from the api. Right now, it is 3 hours cron job? speed and volume of the data coming from the validic to baseline
Do we haveduplication of the messages/events in our stream and how to handle duplication?
Data reliability: For the activity whether we have user information or not. both of the activity and user queues are dependent but think of edge cases? 
Encoding of the messages: forward and backward schema compatibility
fault tolerance of the rabbitMQ ? 
events
number of partitions for the topics? right now we have 1
hyper log log to check the duplication of the messages from the queues. what if same id comes in again
kafka supports one schematics? [Are we using Exactly one delivery semantics or at least once? If at least once, how are we protecting from dups]
always save the activity data and score with timestamp what if in future they change the process of calculating the score [Look at the concept of event sourcing]
when to use kafka and spark? do we really need spark? exercise
check the frequency of polling by the kafka consumer on spark?
if the spark job is slower then there will be a lot of back pressure on the kafka queues and it will affect the hits/requests being served


use smbj lib over jcifs as it uses smb2 and smb3 protocol.

incase of failure messages push it to death letter queue
death queue: http://activemq.apache.org/message-redelivery-and-dlq-handling.html
apache camel


imap protocol using javamail you can read and write both pop3 only read
(NTLM) is the authentication protocol
smbj protocol faster than smb2
